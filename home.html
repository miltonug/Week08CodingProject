    <h4>The Geography</h4>
    <p>Uganda, officially the Republic of Uganda, is a landlocked country in East Africa. The country is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. Uganda is one of only 11 countries in the world that the Equator passes through dividing the planet into the Northern and the Southern Hemispheres.</p>
    <h4>The History</h4>
    <p>Uganda is named after the Buganda kingdom, which encompasses a large portion of the south of the country, including the capital Kampala, and whose language Luganda is widely spoken throughout the country. From 1894, the area was ruled as a protectorate by the United Kingdom, which established administrative law across the territory. Uganda gained independence from the UK on 9 October 1962.</p>
    <h4>The Present</h4>
    <p>As of 2023, it has a population of around 49.6 million, of which 8.5 million live in the capital and largest city of Kampala. The official language is English, although the Constitution states that "any other language may be used as a medium of instruction in schools or other educational institutions or for legislative, administrative, or judicial purposes as may be prescribed by law."</p>
